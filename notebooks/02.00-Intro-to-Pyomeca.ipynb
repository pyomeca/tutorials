    "\n",
    "- Object-oriented architecture where each class is associated with common and specialized functionalities:\n",
    "  - **Markers3d**: 3d markers positions\n",
    "  - **Analogs3d**: analogs (emg, force or any analog signal)\n",
    "  - **GeneralizedCoordinate**: generalized coordinate (joint angle)\n",
    "  - **RotoTrans**: roto-translation matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specialized functionalities include signal processing routine commonly used in biomechanics: filters, normalization, onset detection, outliers detection, derivative, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each functionality can be chained. In addition to making it easier to write and read code, it allows you to add and remove analysis steps easily (such as Lego blocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each class inherits from a numpy array, so you can create your own analysis step easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy reading and writing interface to common files in biomechanics:\n",
    "  - **c3d**: `from_c3d` and `to_c3d`\n",
    "  - **csv**: `from_csv` and `to_csv`\n",
    "  - **mat**: `from_mat` and `to_mat`\n",
    "  - **sto**: `to_sto` (must install pyosim)\n",
    "  - **trc**: `to_trc` (must install pyosim)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common linear algebra routine implemented: get Euler angles to/from roto-translation matrix, create a system of axes, set a rotation or translation, transpose or inverse, etc."
